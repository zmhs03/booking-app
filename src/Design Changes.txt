I have made design changes to the following:

1. History (Dashboard):
-I have removed the History section. It seemed redundant to include it as the user could 
favourite their favourite businesses and revisit them for the services they would like to do.

2. Search Bar (Home and Navbar):
-Both the search bars in the homepage hero section and the navbar have been removed. 
The hero section's search bar was interfering with page routing, while the navbar's search bar was generating persistent, 
unexplained errors despite thorough debugging.

3. Account (Dashboard):
-Chose a cleaner interface that displays only input fields for user information.

4. Log Out Button (Dashboard)
- The log out functionality is already accessible via the navbar, avoiding duplication.
